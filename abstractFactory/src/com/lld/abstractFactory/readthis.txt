This is an in-complete version of abstract factory ,

abstract factory is mostly asked in sde-2 lvls ( not ruling out the possibility of asking in sde1's)

focus mostly on simple factory and factory method patterns for sde1 lvl and abstract factory for further lvls
( I am expecting you to upgrade this code)
