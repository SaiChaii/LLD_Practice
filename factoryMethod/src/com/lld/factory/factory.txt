Factory Pattern Notes

Purpose:
Factory Pattern is used to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.

Why use it:

Avoids using new everywhere

Centralizes object creation

Reduces coupling between client and concrete classes

Allows easy extensibility

When to use:

When object creation logic is conditional or complex

When the system needs flexibility in choosing object types

Key idea:
Client calls factory, factory decides which object to return.

Benefits:

Maintainable and scalable code

Easy to add new types without modifying client code

Removes dependency on specific classes

Analogy:
Client is like a customer ordering food, factory is the kitchen preparing it, products are different dishes.

Structure:

Interface or base type

Concrete implementations

Factory class containing logic to create correct object

Client that requests objects from factory

Interview note:
Factory Pattern uses one factory class.
Factory Method Pattern involves subclasses overriding creation logic.
